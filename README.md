# Personal-Budget
â€‹	This is a budget Excel workbook I created for personal use, as well as to demonstrate my competency in Excel. In the first section, I will describe how to use the workbook and explain the basic premise behind it. In the second section (to be added later), I will go into much more depth on how I created each sheet. I also plan to add more features in the future, including a debt-specific dashboard.

The first sheet in the workbook is a settings sheet. Here you can specify the starting year which is the year you wish to begin tracking. Also, you can choose to activate or deactivate the shift late income feature, and what day you would like to start shifting late income. This feature is useful if you happen to receive income late in the month and want it to count towards next months income.
