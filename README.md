# Personal-Budget
Here's a revised version of your text:

This is a budget Excel workbook I created for personal use, as well as to demonstrate my competency with Excel. In the first section, I will describe how to use the workbook and explain the basic premise behind it. In the second section (to be added later), I will go into much more depth on how I created each sheet. I also plan to add more features in the future, including a debt-specific dashboard.
