# Personal Budget
​	This is a budget Excel workbook I created for personal use, as well as to demonstrate my competency in Excel. In the first section, I will describe how to use the workbook and explain the basic premise behind it. In the second section (to be added later), I will go into much more depth on how I created each sheet. I also plan to add more features in the future, including a debt-specific dashboard.

## Section 1



## Settings

​	The first sheet in the workbook is a settings sheet. Here you can specify the starting year which is the year you wish to begin tracking. Also, you can choose to activate or deactivate the shift late income feature, and what day you would like to start shifting late income. This feature is useful if you happen to receive income late in the month and want it to count towards next months income. 

## Budget Planning

​	In this sheet you are able to set your budget each month up to the next eight years! This is a zero based budget meaning every dollar that comes in should be allocated to a subcategory. The income left to be allocated will be in the corresponding month cell under the year.  It is possible to easily add more subcategories by unhiding the hidden rows between the last subcategory and the total row.

## Budget Tracking

![](https://github.com/CodyFHPearson/Personal-Budget/blob/main/budget_tracking.png)

​	Here is where all the day to day transactions will be recorded. There are dropdown lists and data validation rules for each for the first three columns to insure accurate records. The different amounts are also color coded for easy reference. As shown in the png above the records do not need to be entered in sequential order for the balance to be correct,however with the filter button on the date column it is easy to re-sort them. The effective date column will only become active when the "shift late income" feature is active and will shift all dates after the starting shift date to the first of the next month. 

### Budget Dashboard

​	The budget dashboard sheet pulls from the budget planning and budget tracking sheet to offer a comprehensive look at what went well or not so well in the budget. It is possible to look at each month or a total year view with the the dropdown menus in the top right hand corner.
